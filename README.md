# dungeon

ASCII hack-and-slash game inspired by old AD&amp;D and BSD hack.

The only executable that is built at present is the unit-tests executable, and
not much has so far been implemented.  What I have so far are only:

- Infrastructure for simulating the roll of dice.
- Code representing character abilities.
- Code representing character races.
